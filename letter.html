<p>Dear Ally,</p>
<p>If there's one thing that I know, it's that I have been blessed by our relationship. Hearing your side of the satrt of our relationship really warms my heart. You have always wanted us to date, and here we are a year down the road. You have always been by my side since the start of our story. Even when we have our fair share of ups and downs, I can always count on you. One thing this year taught me is what it's ike to really love somebody. To love you when you're happy, sad, mad, stubborn, tired, all of the emotions imaginable. Through all of them, I have never lovd you any less, 100% honesty. I get annoyed, upset, furstrated at times, yet at the end of the day I still want you, and I want you for the rest of my life. I want you to be my wife, bestfriend, gaurdian angel, and the mother of my children. YOu are on e of th best things that has ever happened to me, and I will cherish you until my final breath.</p>
<p>Ally, I want you to know that you are the one that brought me out of my comfort zone. I had put up so many boundaries and sold myself off from ever dating another woman until I graduated College, but then you came along and rocked my world. You showed me what it honestly felt like to be loved. For so long I used to be the only one to give love, it was rarely returned. You, you gave back and continously give back so much love that some days I am overrun with it. You are a blessing from God, and one that I will contiously hold on to because you treat me so right, even when I don't dserve to be.</p> 
<p> Ally Nicole Blount, I want you to know just how <strong>AMAZING</strong> you are. You are the most beatufil, kind hearted, loving, passionate, determined, kind, gentle woman of God that I have ever met. You show me day in and day out what it is like to love, and I want to thank you. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for never giving up on me. And thank you for the future that we are going to share with each other.</p>
<p>Your Penguin, Ice Queen, and Future Husband,<br>Christopher James Bates</p>
