<td> This one is easy, the Helen trip with you, me, Caroline, Jordynne, and Tess. While the traffic was impossibly horrible, the memories made there with you were spectacular. Going around walking too all the small shops in Helen, it really showed me a glimpse of what our future has in store. Taking family vacations or just you and me get aways to small towns and exploring all the neat places they have. I honestly cannot wait to be able to share more of these memories with you</td>

<td> Decorating Christmas cookies with you was such a wonderful experience (even though yours lacks some creativity in this picutre :P). This memory definilty solidifies more thoughts of our future when we get to celebrate Christmas on our own and with our children one day. Being able to just sit down and make crazy Christmas cookies together is something that I honestly look forward to. Something so simple, yet so enjoyable when you are there doing it alongside me.</td>

<td> Ah yes, this was an interesting night with a roller coaster of emotions. This is when you opened up to me about how you feel with pictures and "trying to pose" and how you were feeling uncomfortable and just awkward. I still have every single picture we took that night, and I refuse to have them deleted from my camera roll because I honestly do think that you are one of the most beautiful females I have EVER seen. And you seriously rocked the pictures</td>

<td> Here is proof that you do infact fall asleep more than I did in the beginning of the relationship. Real talk, it brings joy to know that you are comfortable just taking a nap when I am with you. Being your pillow and being able to reassure you when you wake up from a nightmare just fills my heart and I just see FUTURE everytime. I just love you so much!!</td>
