<p> Hello Ally,<br> When you told me that you wanted something free (or nothing at all, but we both know that was not an option) I had literrally NO idea what to get you. What could I possibly make or give you that could truly express how I feel about you, how much I love, cherish, and genuinely enjoy having you apart of my life. Needless to say, I still have no idea what could possibly encompass all the emotions I feel for you, so I decided to use my geeky side to at least attempt to express myself. And I really hope this works out and that you like it.</p>
